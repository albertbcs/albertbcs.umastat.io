      notes: "Since Oguri Cap can be either a Pace Chaser or a Late Surger, having high Power and Speed will help her, as this lets her easily overtake her opponents. Stamina is not as important, but i still good to train. Having high Wit also helps her activate her skills."

      stats: { Speed: 900, Stamina: 900, Power: 700, Wisdom: 400, Guts: 400 },
      notes: "Because Symboli Rudolf prefers Medium and Long races while using a Pace Chaser or Late Surger style, she will need a lot of Speed, Stamina, and Power in that order. This will let her run fast for longer, as well as easily overtake her opponents. She has a 20% Stamina growth bonus, which should help her get the Stamina she needs."

      notes: "As a Medium race runner who prefers staying in the Front, Mihono Bourbon performs well with high Speed and Stamina, as well as some Power for better acceleration and overtaking. It's also ideal to have a high enough wit to help activate skills and prevent the Rushed status that can affect her performance and the activation of her Unique Skill."

      notes: "As a Medium and Long racer with an aptitude for Pace Chaser, Biwa Hayahide will need as much Speed and Stamina as possible.

      notes: "Similar to the original version, this version of Mejiro McQueen is still a Long and Medium racer, so Stamina is still a must. Other than Stamina, you must also increase her Speed and Power, so that she has an easier time overtaking her opponents. Stamina and Power should be relatively easy to level at the same time thanks to her +10% growth buff on both stats. This growth buff also applies to her Wit, so increase that when able."

      notes: "Similar to the original Tokai Teio, this version excels in Medium Races, so build Speed and Stamina to help her with her Pace Chaser style. Afterward, increase her Power and Guts to help her break out of groups, as well as to help her during the final spurt. Lastly, level her Wit to help with Skill activation."

      stats: { Speed: 1000, Stamina: 500, Power: 800, Wisdom: 400, Guts: 400 },
      notes: "As a Sprinter, Curren Chan thrives in having high Speed and Power, as Sprinters don't need a lot of Stamina. This is especially true for Curren Chan, as she prefers being a Pace Chaser. Prioritize getting her Speed high, followed by Power. You can then give her some Stamina so she does not fall behind."

      notes: "As a Late Surger in Medium and Mile Races, Vodka does well when she has high Speed and Power that can let her easily overtake her opponents. High Wit also helps with skill activation and maneuvering. She will still need Stamina to help her get through races, so increase it as well."
